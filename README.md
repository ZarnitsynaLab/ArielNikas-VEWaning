# ArielNikas-VEWaning
For VE waning project focused on comparing methods using an ABM. This constitutes 3 main parts:

1)Julia code for running the simulation. Included is the basic simulation used through most of the paper. Julia files end in .jl while files that describe packages, versions, and the general environment are found in the .toml files

2)R code for analyzing the simulation. Included is a .csv file for an example simulation. (Some additional code for easier figure generation also)

3)Files for the paper, supplement, and reviewer response
